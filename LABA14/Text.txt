I am a sixth-former. This year we have begun to study some new subjects. They are Literature, Geography, Botany, Ancient History, French or German. At Geography we study the world around us, at Botany — different plants, at History — the life of people in the ancient times. There are so many things to do, to learn and to see. We cannot afford to go to-the cinema or just for a walk very often, because we don't have enough time. There are six or seven lessons oil our timetable every day. Some of them are my favourite ones. 
We have Maths every day. It's the science of numbers. People say, Maths is hard. As for me, I don't agree. If you know the tables, it's as easy as ABC. At the lessons we learn to add, divide, multiply and subtract, because everybody uses numbers and Mathematics every day: when we go shopping, plan something, build houses, plant corn and vegetables and so on. As for me, I am good at Maths. 
Drawing is an interesting subject, too. I'm fond of drawing and painting. When we draw, we make pictures with a pen or chalk. When we paint, we make pictures with paint. We may paint in water- colours or in oils. It is not easy to paint in oils. At the lessons we speak about famous artists and their paintings. It helps me to understand the beauty. 
There is a Museum of Fine Arts in our city. There are many paintings of Belarusian, Russian and foreign artists there. 
If we want to make a good drawing, we must have a good eye, see and watch, learn to compare things and have rich imagination. 
Drawing helps us in many subjects: in Geography, History, Botany, Literature. We understand things better, remember the facts and learn things quicker if there are pictures in the books and our textbooks. Drawing is a useful subject, I think. I'm good at Drawing.
